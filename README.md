## How we built it

    We got the design layout, I created the planner in Trello and the basic structure of the first page, sticking to the BEM. Then we divided the amount of work into smaller parts. We had daily working meetings to synchronise our efforts to build the website.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We are proud of our teamwork. We pulled it off despite working in different time zones. We gained invaluable experience working as a team!
